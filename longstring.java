The Republic Day 2011 parade was well received by the President of India. The Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was the invited Chief Guest. While the Indian defense forces impressed the spectators by demonstrating their might and discipline, the cultural aspect of the parade was equally enthralling.  The tableau of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj brought forward the principles of local self governance by displaying the symbolic village tree which hosts panchayats across India.The tableau from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) highlighted the theme of man’s harmony with nature which has been a characteristic of traditional Indian living. The tableau not only depicted the rich biodiversity of India but also illustrated traditional sustainable lifestyle of the people of India. The tableau of the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) decorated itself with tigers beautifully crafted from flowers and highlighted the cause of the dwindling numbers of the big cat.  The participants of the tableau also carried banners which read “Baag Bachao” and “Save Tiger” in different languages.");
